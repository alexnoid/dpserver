https://vk.com/id450522484,"['‚ûù Transcript The Covid-Plan / Rockefeller Lockstep 2010 ‚Äî Full Text of Permanent World Lockdown Plot üåê \n \nAnd that is yourNew World Order: technology on steroids where you have no option but to comply. And if anyone thinks that this isn‚Äôt true, then go and check out some parts of Chinabecause they‚Äôve already started some of the cryptocurrencies system in place in certain areas. So, this is the outline of their plan. And what we have to stop by outing itin as many places as possible. And also calling out Q and Trump and asking them: Are you going to stop this?Mass arrests are irrelevant. This is essential and this has to be blocked. \n \nThey hypothesizea simulated global outbreakrequiredsteps, variousphases, overalltimelines, and expected outcomes. This was posited in the Rockefeller Lockstep 2010: \n \n‚ûù Create a very contagious but super low mortality rate virus to fit theneededplan. Using SARS, HIV, Hybrid Research Strain created at Fort DietrichClass 4 lab from 2008 to 2013 as part of a research project to find out why corona viruses spread like wildfire inbatsbut have an extremely hard time infecting humans. To counteract that, they added 4 HIVinserts into the virus. Themissing key to infect the human is the Ace-2-Receptor. \n \n‚ûù Create a weaponized version of the virus with a much higher mortality rate as a backup plan. Ready to be released in Phase 3,but only if needed. SARS, HIV, MERS, Weaponized Tribit Strain created at Fort Dietrich Class 4lab in 2015. \n \n‚ûù Transport the Research Strain to different Class 4 lab,the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg Canada, and have it ‚Äústolen and smuggled out by China‚Äù,Xi Jang Lee,on purpose and taken to China‚Äôs only Class 4 lab which is Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan China.For added plausible deniabilityand to help cement thewanted backup public script as something to fall back on if needed.The primary script being its natural.Backup script being that China created it and released it by accident. \n \n‚ûù Fund all the talking heads:Fauci, Birx, Tedrosand agencies, World Health Organization, NIAID, the CDC and also the UN,that would be involved with pandemic response prior to the planned release of the Research Strain to control the wanted script throughout the operation. \n \n‚ûù Create and fund the vaccination development and roll out plan so it‚Äôs capable of being rolled out on a global scale.Gates: ADecade of Vaccines and the Global Action Vaccine action plan, 2010to 2020. \n \n‚ûù Create and fund the vaccination, verification and certificationprotocols, Digital ID,to enforce/confirm the vaccination program after the mandatory roll out is enacted.Gates:ID2020. \n \n‚ûù Simulate the lockstephypothesisjust prior to the planned Research Strain release using a real-world exercise as a final war game to determine expected response, timelines, and outcomes, Event 201in Oct 2019. \n \n‚ûù Release the Research Strain at the Wuhan Instituteof Virology itselfand then blame its release on a natural scapegoatas thewanted primary script.Wuhan wet market, Nov 2019. Exactly the same as the simulation. \n \n‚ûù Downplay the human-to-human transmission for as long as possible to allow the Research Strain to spread on a global scale before any country can lock downrespondto avoid initial infection. \n \n‚ûù Once a countryhas seen infection in place, lock downincoming/outgoing travel. Keep the transmission within the country spreading for as long as possible. \n \n‚ûù Once enough peoplein a country/ regionare infected,enact forced quarantines/isolation for that area and expandthe lockdown regions slowly over time‚Ä¢Overhype the mortality rate by tying the Research Strain todeaths that have little to nothing to do with the actual virus to keep the fear and compliance at a maximum. \n \n‚ûù If anyone dies for any reason and is foundto have Covid, consider it a Covid death. And if anyone is thought to of maybe had symptoms of Covid, assume they have Covid, and consider it as a Covid death. \n \n‚ûù Keep the public quarantines for as long as possible to destroy the region‚Äôs economy, create civil unrest, break down the supply chain,and cause the start of mass food shortages. As well as cause people‚Äôs immune system to weaken due to a lack of interaction with other people‚Äôs bacteria, the outside world, akathe things that keep our immune systems alert and active. \n \n‚ûù Downplay and attack any potential treatments and continue to echothat the only cure that is viable to fight this virus is the vaccine. \n \n‚ûù Continue to drag out the quarantine over and over again in ‚Äútwo-week intervals‚Äù[There is that two weeks spell casting again .It is a CIA program.] causingmore and more people toeventuallystand up and protest. Defy them. \n \n‚ûù [And here is the key part to now‚ò∫ Eventually end Phase 1quarantine once they get enough public push back, expected June 2020, and publicly state that they think it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo early to end the isolation, but I‚Äôm going to do it anyways.‚Äù \n \n‚ûù Once the public go back to normal, wait a few weeks and continue to overhype the Research Strain mortality rate, Aug to Sept 2020, and combine it with the increase in deaths due to people dying fromstandard illnessesat a higher rate than normal due to having highly weakened immune systems from months of being in isolation [Which backs up what I said:you should social-distance peoplewho wear masks regular. That‚Äôs what they‚Äôvejust told you.Theyhave highly weakened immune systems.] to help further pad the mortality rate and also hype theup and coming Phase 2 lockdown. \n \n‚ûù Eventually, enact Phase 2quarantines,Oct throughNov 2020, on an even more extreme level and blame the protesters,mostly people who don‚Äôt trust their governments already,as the cause of the largest second wave whereby themedia will say‚Äòwe told you so. It was too early. It‚Äôs all your own fault because you neededa haircut. Your freedoms have consequences.‚Äô [Should this all unfold in this manner, the US election will be cancelleddelayed or suspended. My opinion. How can you vote with Phase 2 quarantines? You can‚Äôt.] \n \n‚ûù Enforce the Phase 2 quarantines at a much more extremelevelincreasing the penalty for defiance. Replace fines with jail time. Deem all travel as non-essential.Increase checkpoints, including military assistance. Increase tracking/tracing after populationvia mandatory app. Take over control offood, gas, and create large scale shortages so that people can only get access to essential products or services if they are first given permission. \n \n‚ûù Keep the Phase 2 lockdown in place for amuch longer period of time than the Phase 1 lockdown, continuingto destroy the global economy.Further degrade the supply chain and further amplify the food shortages and the like.Quell any public outrage using extreme actions or forceand make anyone who defies them appear as public enemy \ufeff#1\ufeff to those who are willing to submit. \n \n‚ûù After a rather long Phase 2 lockdown of 6 months plus, roll out the vaccination program and the vaccine certification and make it mandatory for everyone, giving priority access to those that submitted from the startand have those that are for itattack those that are against it, saying ‚Äòthey are a threat and the cause of all the problems‚Äôby using words like ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt go back to normal until everyone takes the vaccine.‚Äù And people defying them are ‚Äúhurting our way of lifeand therefore are the enemy.‚Äù[In other words they are going to turn the people against each other.] \n \n‚ûù If the majority of people go along with the agenda,then let those people enter the new system, the new normal, while limiting the minority that defied the agenda‚Äôs ability to work, travel and live. \n \n‚ûù If the majority of people go against the agenda, then release the Weaponized SARS/HIV/MERS Tribit Strainas a Phase 3 operation. A virus with a 30+% mortality rateas a final scare to punish the minority to quickly become the majority and give a final ‚ÄúWe told you so‚Äù to those that didn‚Äôt listen. \n \n‚ûù Enact the new economy model. Microsoft patent060606 crypto currency systemusing body activity datawhich is based on human behavior and willingness to submit. It is a tweakedversionof the black mirrors 15 million merits programusing food, water, shelter, and other essentials as a weapon of enforcement of the new economic system.Basically,do what we want and get rewarded.

https://vk.com/id450337252,"['By Cory Morningstar \nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is described as, ‚Äúsystems that combine sophisticated hardware and software with elaborate databases and knowledge-based processing models to demonstrate characteristics of effective human decision making.‚Äù [Source] The World Economic Forum recognizes AI as ‚Äúthe engine of the Fourth Industrial Revolution‚Äù. [Source] AI as applied/ utilized by social media platforms is trained with an objective and exploitative function: target users with ads for maximum ad revenue, by highlighting the newsfeed ensuring users remain on the platform for as many hours, minutes and seconds as possible. This function is highlighted by The Social Dilemma, while, ultimately, the sole function of every corporation, that of increasing revenues and maximizing profits ‚Äì ad infinitum, is kept opaque. \nAny technology that has power can be corrupted. In this respect, AI is perhaps the most dangerous. Hacking (PC, mobiles, viruses) is accomplished by injecting code ‚Äì code that can be then detected. Deep learning, referred to as artificial intelligence, is a giant array of numbers. The AI models are self-modifying on a continuous basis, thus, it is unknown how hacking AI can ‚Äì or will ‚Äì be aptly detected. [Source: October 5, 2018, The Artificial Intelligence Race and the New World, Order, Council on Foreign Relations ‚Äì The Malcolm and Carolyn Wiener Lecture on Science and Technology]. ‚ÄúImagine tens of millions of numbers in the deep learning algorithm that‚Äôs updating itself anyway, because it‚Äôs getting more data, retraining itself. Some bad people just tweak a few numbers and all of a sudden, it might be out of control.‚Äù [Source] Meaning, for example, a hacker may succeed in turning autonomous vehicles into autonomous weapons that kill people en masse. Imagine fully autonomous nuclear weapons or autonomous nuclear power plants, the hacking of which ‚Äì or malfunction of ‚Äì could result in the annihilation of an entire nation, or the entire planet. \nHere again, it is more important what both The Social Dilemma and the Center for Humane Technology do not divulge, rather than what they do. The Fourth Industrial Revolution cannot come into fruition without the 5G infrastructure that will run the Internet of Things. ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù cities must be understood within the context of global policing and the military industrial complex. Cybersecurity will be the battle space of the 21st century. \n‚ÄúThe potential for nuclear escalation in a conventional conflict with autonomous systems is compounded by the way that autonomous systems could enable adopters to fight faster than those operating non-autonomous systems do at present‚Ä¶ A military force that is heavily invested in AI could essentially enable faster operations by autonomous systems relative to remotely-piloted or inhabited systems. Some Chinese scholars have hypothesized that this trend could result in a ‚Äúbattlefield singularity,‚Äù in which the pace of action on the battlefield eclipses the speed of human decision-making.‚Äù [Source] \nRemarks to the Association of the U.S. Army Annual Convention, October 4, 2016, as Delivered by Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work, Washington, D.C.: \nQ: ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt mention about autonomous systems. In light of the third off-set strategy, what is your thinking about letting in the future autonomous systems make lethality decisions without a human in the loop?‚Äù \nA: ‚ÄúI purposely didn‚Äôt talk a lot about the technology behind the third off-set because in a audience like this, you get that the most important thing is the operational concepts and the organizational constructs that employ that technology. But let me state this, state it this way. There will be some instances where operations are happening at machine speeds and we will have to rely upon A.I. and autonomy to actually fight.‚Äù [Source] \nAutomation bias is when humans effectively surrender their judgment to machines: \n‚ÄúOf particular concern in the design of intelligent decision support systems is the human tendency toward automation bias, which occurs when a human decision maker disregards or does not search for contradictory information in light of a computer-generated solution which is accepted as correct. Operators are likely to turn over decision processes to automation as much as possible due to a cognitive conservation phenomenon and teams of people, as well as individuals, are susceptible to automation bias.‚Äù [Further reading: Automation Bias in Intelligent Time Critical Decision Support System, AIAA 1st Intelligent Systems Technical Conference, 20-22 September, 2004] \nTo fully comprehend this risk, a cognitive conservation phenomenon, one must contemplate the Stanislav Petrov incident. In 1983, the satellite-based Soviet Oko nuclear early warning system detected that an intercontinental ballistic nuclear missile had been launched by the United States. The automated system reported, with the ‚Äúhighest‚Äù confidence, that a U.S. missile strike was underway. Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov, on duty, was responsible for alerting his Soviet superiors of the attack. The siren sounded while a large screen instructed ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù in bold red letters. The siren continued to sound as the computer identified a secondary, third, fourth and fifth missile launch, changing its instruction from ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù to ‚Äúmissile strike.‚Äù Doubting the accuracy of the computer system, Petrov did not react with counter missiles, later explaining ‚ÄúI had a funny feeling in my gut‚Äù. He resisted falling victim to automation bias and reported a system malfunction to his superiors, rather than responding with a counter strike. Rather than launching a nuclear war. Rather than ceding his own judgment to a machine. If this had of been a fully autonomous system, as desired by global technocrats, the counter strike would have been automatic, likely unimpeded by human intervention. \n[In his own words: Ex-Soviet officer Stanislav Petrov reported a possible 1983 US missile launch as a false alarm: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7EmLf4Xlq0] \nIn 2003, U.S. army investigators found that automation bias was pervasive within the ‚ÄúPatriot community‚Äù, which espoused a culture of ‚Äútrusting the system without question‚Äù. ‚ÄúPatriot operators‚Äù exhibited an ‚Äúunwarranted and uncritical trust in automation. In essence, control responsibility [was] ceded to the machine.‚Äù [Source] \n‚ÄúThe more a country fears that, in a world without using autonomous systems, its ability to retaliate to a nuclear strike would be at risk, the more attractive autonomous systems may appear.‚Äù \n‚Äî A Stable Nuclear Future? The Impact of Autonomous Systems and Artificial Intelligence, December 2019 \n6G promises increased bio-cybernetic identity (identity critical service architecture, sensing based machine learning, distribution of trust) and cyber security. Now consider activity that is deemed criminal by larger society. Rather than obtaining physical keys and/or passwords to acquire access, one will require biometric access. That is, heads (face recognition), eyes (retina scanning), and/or hands. \nThe AI arms race between China and the US is already well underway (with China having launched its blockchain in April 2020, for global commercial use). The idea that regulation and safeguards cab be applied to AI, ensuring both privacy and data are protected, borders on the edge of a collective psychosis. Such are the lies we tell ourselves in order to sleep at night. \n‚ÄúThe Fourth Industrial Revolution and Its Impact on Occupational Health and Safety, Worker‚Äôs Compensation and Labor Conditions‚Äù, September, 2019: \n‚ÄúIn FIR [fourth industrial revolution], nonstandard employment will be common. As a result, it is difficult to receive OHS services and compensation. Excessive trust in new technologies can lead to large-scale or new forms of accidents. Global business networks will cause destruction of workers‚Äô biorhythms, some cancers, overwork, and task complexity. The social disconnection because of an independent work will be a risk for worker‚Äôs mental health. The union bonds will weaken, and it will be difficult to apply standardized OHS regulations to multinational enterprises.‚Äù \n\nhttp://www.wrongkindofgreen.org/2020/11/28/the-great-reset-the-final-assault-on-the-living-planet-its-not-a-social-dilemma-its-the-calculated-destruction-of-the-social-part-iii/']"
